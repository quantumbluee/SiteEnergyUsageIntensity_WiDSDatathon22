The dataset consists of roughly 100k records of 'Energy Usage Intensities'(EUI) for the entire life cycle of buildings throughout the United States for 7 years. The dataset consists of building characteristics (e.g. floor area, facility type etc), weather data for the location of the building (e.g. annual average temperature, annual total precipitation etc) as well as the energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI).

The task is to predict the EUI given the building characteristics.
